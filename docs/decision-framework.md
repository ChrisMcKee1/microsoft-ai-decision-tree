# Three-Phase Decision Methodology

This framework integrates Microsoft's [Business-Experience-Technology (BXT) Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/isv/business-envisioning), [Cloud Adoption Framework AI Strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy), and [M365 Copilot Extensibility Decision Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview).

💡 **See [Visual Framework](visual-framework.md) for workflow diagrams** that illustrate how to apply this framework as an intake process.

## Phase 1: Business Impact Assessment (BXT Framework)

Before evaluating technology options, validate the use case through three dimensions. **All three must score medium-high to proceed.**

### 1. Viability (Business)

- ROI beyond general productivity gains?
- Quantifiable cost savings or revenue increase?
- Strategic alignment?
- TCO vs. benefit analysis?

### 2. Desirability (Experience)

- Motivating reason to use over current alternative?
- Solves painful, frequent problem?
- Measurable adoption?
- Natural workflow fit?

### 3. Feasibility (Technology)

- Current team skillsets?
- Hire/train/partner decisions?
- Data accessible & governable?
- Infrastructure and compliance ready?

### Decision Gate

- ❌ **Any dimension scores low** → Revisit use case, defer project, or move to "Research/Incubate" quadrant
- ✅ **All dimensions score medium-high** → Proceed to Phase 2 (Technology Selection)

---

## Phase 2: Technology Groupings (Six Critical Questions)

Apply these questions **sequentially** after passing the BXT assessment. Each question creates **technology groupings** rather than jumping to specific recommendations. The groupings feed into Phase 3 for final selection.

💡 **Important:** These questions create buckets/categories. Final technology selection happens in **Phase 3** based on scenario-specific criteria (time-to-market, complexity, budget, etc.).

- **API/Headless** (Backend services, no UI)

**Resulting Groupings:**
- **M365-Centric Technologies**: M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio (M365 channels), Graph Connectors, Declarative Agents
- **Multi-Channel Technologies**: M365 Agents SDK, Copilot Studio (custom channels), Azure AI Foundry, Logic Apps
